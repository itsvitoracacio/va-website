This week, the company I worked at for the past two years closed down operations and I was out of a job.

Do I look for another job or do I finally start that business I was already considering doing on the side?

<mark>One of the key benefits of starting a business on the side</mark> (while you have a job) <mark>is the peace of mind that comes with it</mark>.

It's easier to sleep at night knowing that you can take your time to build the build the business without the pressure of it having to work out by a specific date, *or else*.

Your business has a higher chance of making it since you don't need to make desperate decisions. This is usually stuff like taking in the wrong type of client, or chasing unprofitable projects just because you think they're an easier sale and you need the money right now.

If you start a business while on a job, you can also use the steady income from your job to fund some of the business costs as they appear. That allows you to test more stuff and to get more done in the business before it has the revenue to be able to pay for that stuff by itself.

Essentially, <mark>you can take more risks in your business</mark>.

Now, when you go at it without a job (and by job I mean any activity that you do regularly in exchange for a sure paycheck), it has a higher intrinsic risk.

I mean, <span class="yellow-u">you can only start a business without a job if you have saved up enough money so that you can afford to stay out of a job for a while</span>.

At least long enough for your business to reach a level of steady profit that is equal to your monthly bills.

And, of course, you can try to lower your bills so you can reach that point faster. But still, you will be working against the clock, trying to fill a leaking bucket.

I've done it that way before.

And all I could think of was this one survival metric:

<span class="yellow-u">"How many months do I have until I run out of money?"</span>

Each day that goes by decreases the number. And each new profitable client coming in increases the number.

That was literally all I could think about while going through the day, which can be *a bit stressful*.

And at the time, I didn't have my own family, or a lot of bills to my name, and I was living with my parents, which reduced the pressure by a lot.

So, <mark>as you get older and have more grown-up responsibilities, your intrinsic risk gets higher</mark>.

Now, on the other hand, if you're trying to build a business without a job, you can focus on it 100%, as you have no other work distractions, and can dedicate most of your day to it.

## So, which one is better?

Well, as a lot of things in life, there isn't a right and a wrong answer. You need to consider your specific situation.

Here's a few points to think about that may help you make this decision:

### If you're considering starting a business with no job:

- What's the amount of risk that you'd be taking?
- Are you comfortable taking that much risk?
- What's the worst thing that can happen if it doesn't work out?
- What are the odds of this thing happening?
- How would you deal with that situation?
- How would you know that it didn't work? Like, is there a specific thing that will happen or not happen by some date so that you will know that you didn't make it?
- In case you decide you can't handle it anymore, for whatever reason, how quitable is it?
- How quickly would you be able to get a job in case you determined that it hadn't worked?

### If you're considering starting a business while having a job:

- Would you be able to dedicate enough time and energy to building your business if you still have all your other responsibilities, including a job?
- How important is it for you that this new business works out?
- Why do you want to do it?
- Is there easier ways to achieve your end goal? Considering your business would be a means to an end, be it a personal, financial, social or any other type of goal.

## What I'm gonna do

In my situation, after balancing it out, I decided to start the business right now while look for a part time job.

That would be an amount of risk I'd be very comfortable with. I'd be getting some regular income to pay most of my bills and give this business the time it needs to work out. And at the same time, I'd be able to dedicate enough time and energy to it for a longer period in the day.

At least I think I would.

Of course, this is the ideal situation. Let's see how it really goes.
