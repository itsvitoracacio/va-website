Without a job, my main goal is to have a new source of income as fast as I can. Also because I'm out of a job, I want something that doesn't require any significant amount of money to get started.

More than that, as a lesson from the last business that I had, I was looking for an idea that I could build a solid foundation with, and that could last for more than a decade.

That is, instead of a fragile, opportunity based, fad type of business.

So the question I had in my mind was: How can I make a similar amount of money that I made at my job, as fast as I can, while building a solid business?

## I started with the first part: "a similar amount of money that I made at my job".

It needed to be something that could generate a few thousand dollars per month in profit that I could take home, not in revenue.

That meant that I needed to factor in all costs to operate the business, to acquire customers, to pay taxes and to deliver the thing that would be sold. Only after taking it all off, I'd have my net income.

### Operating the business

### Acquiring customers

### Paying taxes

### Delivering what was sold





What's interesting about the timing that the company is closing, is that tomorrow I'm finishing a challenge of coding for 30 days straight. I'm doing it for fun, and that's because I wanted to refresh everything I knew before moving to more advanced stuff, like blockchain and smart contracts.

So, coincidently, I just finished a training project for a course I'm doing, as well as building this  website.






I think most of us have already decided which type of business to start by the time we entertain the idea of actually starting it in a more practical manner.

But some of us, especially when starting a business by necessity, first decide to do it and then go about choosing our business idea.

I've gone through this process several times for myself and with other entrepreneurs I worked with. So I'll go through how I chose my current business idea and while doing this, it will become clear the most important aspects that you need to take into consideration.
